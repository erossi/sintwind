RUN
 At power-on Sint the phone will be checked, if it does not respond
 an idle time of 1h will be execuded blinking 5 times every 10sec.
 You can terminate idle time by grounding the DEBUG switch.

SETUP:
 cell.h: On/off port and PIN.
 Makefile: F_CPU if different from 1Mhz CPU clock.
 init.c: All PORT setup.
 adc.c: Choose which ADC for wind direction.
 adc.h: ADC ratio if not 0 - 4V.
 sht11.h: Port and PIN used by SHT11
 synth.h: Port and PIN used by Synth.

How to set LFUSE bit for external Ceramic OSC at 4Mhz:
 avrdude -c stk500 -p atmega16 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -t -u
 goes into command line mode, then issue:
 dump lfuse
 and change for atmega16 to 0xee with:
 write lfuse 0 0xee

 on atmega16 disable JTAG and free PORTC with:
 dump hfuse
 write hfuse 0 0xd9

Remember 1 means UNPROGRAMMED
From datasheet pag.260 HFUSE
 d = 1101 = OCDEN + JTAGEN + CKOPT are UNPROGRAMMED (default 9 = 1001)
 9 = 1001 = EESAVE + BOOTRST are UNPROGRAMMED (default)
 only JTAGEN has been changed.

pag. 261 LFUSE
 e = 1110 = BODLEVEL + BODEN + SUT1 are UNPROGRAMMED (default)
 e = 1110 = CLKSEL3 + CLKSEL2 + CLKSEL1 are UNPROGRAMMED (default 1 = 0001)
 only CLKSEL3, 2, 1, 0 has been changed.
